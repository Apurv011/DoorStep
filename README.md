## Description

ShapeCam is a mobile application for ecommerce developed using flutter. We have built this app in order to enable users to shop for different kinds of sunglasses as well as prescribed glasses from the comfort of their home.

For backend development we have used Node.js and Express.js to create REST API.
To store the data we have used MongoDB Atlas which offers NoSQL Database.


## Features

* Welcome Page : This is the landing page of our app when the user is not registered.

* Sign-Up Page : It allows user to create an account by filling their basic details.

* Log-In Page : It allows user to enter the app using their credentials.

* Main Page : Displays all the available products.

* Profile Page : User can view and update his account details from this page.

* Product Details Page: Detail such as price, color, description and image of the product is displayed on this page. User can add a particular product into the cart from this page.

* Cart Page : User can review the products added to the cart and proceed to payment.

* Payment Transaction : It allows user to pay for the order using Credit/Debit card, Netbanking, UPI, Wallets. We have developed this payment gateway using RazorPay.
